# ScreenshotActions - Take Quick Actions on the Screenshots!

Sometimes you take a screenshot & you need to quickly copy & delete it, but it takes multiple steps & prompts to perform this action natively. Screenshot actions solves this problem by providing you a quick alert window with the most common actions that a jailbroken user performs ;)
How to Use : Take a screenshot & just long press on the screenshot preview window which shows up in the bottom left corner! From the menu, select the desired action.
Current Supported Features & Actions :

Copying latest screenshot to the clipboard & deleting it
Uploading screenshots directly to Imgur. You will receive a success/error confirmation & the url will be copied to your clipboard!
Sharing screenshots
Delete Image(s)
The preview window usually auto hides after a certain duration, but if you invoke the Screenshot action menu, the preview window will stay & you can perform multiple actions on it!
Additional features will be added in future updates!

No options to configure. Hope the tweak helps you in being productive!
